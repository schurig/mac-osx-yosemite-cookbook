# Workarounds for older devices


## Use AirDrop with older Macs

### Problem
You want to send files to an older Mac using AirDrop.

### Solution
Open Finder and the AirDrop window on both Macs. Make sure that you have WiFi and Bluetooth activated.

Now you need to click on the `Don't see who you're looking for?` dialog and tell AirDrop to also show older Macs.

After that you should be able to see older Macs in AirDrop.

### Discussion
Unfortunately, you have to do that every time you want to send Files to an older Mac. There is no option where you can tell your Mac to remember the setting.

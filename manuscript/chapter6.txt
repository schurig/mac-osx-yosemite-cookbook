## Maximize window without enabling full screen

### Problem
In all old versions of OS X you were able to maximize windows with a simple click on the green control button on the top left. Now, with Yosemite you always enter the full screen when you click on it.

So how to maximize a window without enabling the full screen?

### Solution
**There are two options to do that:**

* Hold the `Alt(⌥)` key and click on the green button.
* Double click somewhere in the top-bar of the window *(does not work in all apps)*.



## Social Media Buttons

### Problem
Since Yosemite the social media buttons in the notification center disappeared by default. How do I get them back?

### Solution
The social media buttons are now a widget that you can activate in your notification center.

There is an other [recipe that shows you how to manage your widgets](#add-widgets-to-your-notification-center).

Next start with step 2 from above.

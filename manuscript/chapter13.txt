## Enabling feedback when changing the volume

### Problem
You want to enable the feedback sound when you change the volume of your Mac.

### Solution
Go into `System Preferences -> Sound` and then click on the `Sound Effects` tab. There you will see a checkbox `Play feedback when volume is changed`. You need to check this checkbox to enable the feedback when changing the volume.

### Discussion
As an alternative you can press the `Shift(â‡§)` key while changing the volume. This gives you the advantage to explicitly tell the operating system when you want the feedback to be played.



## Installing apps on your Mac

### Problem
You want to install an app from the App Store.

### Solution
Open the App Store app and look for the App you want to install. If you don't exactly know what you are looking for, you can just browse through the categories. Click on the app and click the `buy` button and confirm the purchase with entering your Apple ID credentials in case you aren't logged in yet. If you already bought that app before you will see a button labeled with `install` instead.

The app starts to install on your Mac. When it is finished you will be able to see it in your Applications directory and in your Launchpad.

## Batch rename multiple files

### Problem
You want to change the name of multiple files at the same time.

### Solution
With OS X Yosemite there comes a new powerful feature called Batch Rename.

To use that feature just go into a folder where you have multiple files in it that you want to rename. Simply select them and do a right-click and select `Rename [n] Items ...`.

You will see that there is a drop down of three options that you can choose from:

### Replaced Text&nbsp;

With that option you can find words and replace them with something.

### Add text

This option gives you the opportunity to add text **after the name or before**.

### Format

With the format functionality you can choose a format for all files. The format consists of:

*   <span>either a custom string or if the field `Custom Format` is empty, the files current name</span>

*   and an index, counter or date (`Name Format`)

You can of course also choose in which order you want the format to be (`after name` or `before name`). As well you can tell the tool where it should start counting (`Start number at`).

_Tipp: You can always see an example on the bottom._

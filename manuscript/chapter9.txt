## Changing the screenshot directory

### Problem
You want to store your screenshots in a folder that is not the desktop.

### Solution
E. g. create a folder `Screenshots` in your Pictures directory.

What you will need is to open the Terminal and run the following commands:

`mkdir ~/Pictures/Screenshots`

`defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/Screenshots/`

`killall SystemUIServer`

When you now take a screenshot you will see that it will appear in the Screenshots folder that you have created.

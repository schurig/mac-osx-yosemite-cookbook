## Editing pictures with Markup

### Problem
You don't want to open third-party apps like Photoshop to quickly mark a spot on a picture that you want to send to someone.

### Solution
Since OS X Yosemite there is a new feature called Markup.

Markup is a simple tool that you can use right in your Mail app. You can edit pictures with it and sign emails.

To to that just compose a new email with the Mail app. Then drag a file like a .pdf or an image into the composing area.
When you now click on it you will see a small arrow appearing. Click on it and choose `Markup`.

This will open an interface where you can mark things, write words and sign your emails with your signature.

When you're done editing simply hit `Done` in the upper right corner.



## Using Mail Drop to send large files

### Problem
You want to send a large file _(> 36 MB)_ using email.

### Solution
Compose a new email in the Mail app and simply drag and drop the big attachment into the composing area.

As soon you send this email it will ask you: `Would you like to send this attachment using Mail Drop?`

There you can tell the Mail app to use Mail Drop to store the attachment in your iCloud. Instead of the attachment a link will be inserted in your email. The recipient will be able to click on the link and download the large file there.

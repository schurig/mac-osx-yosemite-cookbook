## Sending files to iOS devices

### Problem
You want to send files from your Mac to your iOS device.

### Solution
With OS X Yosemite it is finally possible to send files from OS X to iOS and vice versa. To do so you have to make sure that your iOS device and also your Mac have Bluetooth turned on. On your iOS device also make sure that AirDrop is turned on. Then open AirDrop on your Mac which you can find in Finder.

You will now be able to see your iOS device. Just drag and drop the file on the device you want to send it to. And yes: it works with any kind of file. iOS will ask you with what you want to open the file with in case it doesn't support the file type by default.
